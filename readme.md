Batch Add Game Steam or BAGS for short is an automation script to activate multiple keys on Steam.

But don't take my word for it! Read these quotes!

"Life as a Steam Game Hoarder can be difficult. Redeeming keys bought from a variety of bundles can be difficult and time-consuming. That's why I use BAGS!" - Some Random Guy

"I would never have earned my Game Industry Guardian badge simply redeeming keys in the Steam UI by hand!" - Another Random Person

"Thanks to BAGS I don't have BAGS under my eyes!" - Coffee Addict
