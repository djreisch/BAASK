# ---- Batch Activator for Steam Games ----

##Batch Activator for Steam Games (BASK) can activate keys automatically to your steam account.

###So far there are a few issues in play still
1. The program MUST have the Steam window as the window behind the program window. If it doesn't, the program will return complete for all keys, this create some sub issues
1. The program WON'T work with Steam Skins
2. If you have your Steam window elsewhere or not open, the program won't function correctly
3. In general, the program has several bugs that will be soon fixed in future updates

2. We have still yet to rename the application. Sorry for the confusion

# ---- How To Use ----

###Head over to the Release Page

There you can download the compiled binaries and just run the executable file and be fine.

###Grab the source and complile it yourself

Don't trust an executable you found on the internet? That's ok, go grab the source code from the release page, or clone this repo

# ---- ABOUT ----

This program was originally forked from the "dead" repo maintained by goldenxp, of which was a "Spiritual Successor to SBKA by CoffeeCone".

However I decided instead of making a fork to a dead repository, I will proclaim myself as the new program maintainer.

I like the idead of what CoffeeCone was doing, and what goldenxp tried to revive (he did a good job until it died about a year ago)
so I hope to continue this program so all game horders like me can sit back and relax as our games are activated for us.
