# ---- Batch Auto Activator for Steam Games ----


##Batch Auto Activator for Steam Games (BAASK) can activate game keys automatically to your Steam account.

# ---- How To Use ----

###Head over to the Release Page

There you can download the compiled binaries and just run the executable file and be fine.

###Grab the source and complile it yourself

Don't trust an executable you found on the internet? That's ok, go grab the source code from the release page, or clone this repo

###Launching Program

After you launch BAASK.exe (or compile it yourself, whatever the case) you need to enter in one key per line in the key box and when finished entering keys, click run.
Avoid additional problems by not moving the mouse or using the keyboard until all the keys have been cycled through.

# ---- ABOUT ----

This program was originally forked from the "dead" repo maintained by goldenxp, of which was a "Spiritual Successor to SBKA by CoffeeCone".

However I decided instead of making a fork to a dead repository, I will proclaim myself as the new program maintainer.

I like the idead of what CoffeeCone was doing, and what goldenxp tried to revive (he did a good job until it died about a year ago)
so I hope to continue this program so all game horders like me can sit back and relax as our games are activated for us.
